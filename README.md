Setting Up React.js Project
Follow these steps to set up a new React.js project on your local machine.

Install Node.js and npm
Before starting with React, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

-Visit the official Node.js website and download the latest LTS version.
-Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm.
```
Create a New React App
You can use create-react-app to quickly set up a new React project. It sets up everything you need with zero configuration.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
Replace my-app with your preferred project name.
```
This will:

-Install React and React-DOM
-Set up Webpack and Babel for bundling and transpiling
-Provide a default project structure with some basic files
Navigate into the Project Directory
Once the project is created, navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd my-app
```
Start the Development Server
To start the development server and see your app in action, run:

```bash
npm start
```
This will:

-Launch the React app on http://localhost:3000/ by default
-Automatically open your default browser with the app running
-Enable hot-reloading, so changes you make will be reflected in real-time without needing to refresh the browser.
